# Project
This is a matching card game in which if a user should select two matching cards of 5 choices, they win the game.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
My team and I began with pseudo coding the Javascript to determine the winning logic and flipping action of the cards. We went with a method that involved shifting the classes around via arrays provided by the Window object such as event.target. We managed to get the cards to shuffle using the Fischer-Yates shuffle algorithm.


## Lessons Learned:

Some important takeaways from working on this series was learning how to use debugger in Google Chrome Inspect, how to shuffle results, and selecting classes with event.target.
